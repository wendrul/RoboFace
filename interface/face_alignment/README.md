This code is heavily borrowed from [face-alignment](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment). 
I made changes in the inference part using numba to accelearate. 
Also, a converted onnx model is created by me in the release page to accelerate.

Please note that the code is **not compatible** with the official package anymore. You don't need `pip install face-alignment`.
