# RTUBER

This project is an attempt at making a "Vtuber" avatar out of mechanical components, thus the name RealTuber.

I made a youtube video out of this so chek it out to see how it works (demo starts at [0:47](https://youtu.be/ZomPvazL9Mw?t=47))

### stealing code is my passion

So most of the code is taken from this [repo](https://github.com/kwea123/VTuber_Unity), an open-source vtuber project working with Unity. That is the most interesting part of the code so check it out.

Other deep learning projects borrowed (within the Vtuber_Unity project):
